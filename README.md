# Browser-based Bookworm Adventures

Bookworm Adventures is a word-forming combat-based RPG videogame, created originally by PopCap games. During my childhood, I spent a lot of time playing Bookworm Adventures, obsessing over its quirky characters, and wishing I could add my own characters, levels, and mechanics to the game. Unfortunately, BWA was never a *very* popular game. It eventually fell out of support, and there never was a version of the game playable on Mac or iOS. The only way I've been able to play BWA in the past few years has been through a glitchy, ad-ridden online version that didn't save progress. Yuck.

Since Bookworm Adventures was such a big part of my childhood, I decided to try rebuilding a playable version of it in the browser. You can play a Beta version of the game at [this link](https://bwa.franklin.dyer.me). 

I've done my best to reconstruct the original game's playful vibes through the artwork, dialogue and flavor text. It currently has no *plot* - it's just just RPG-style combat for its own sake, without any princesses to save or big baddies to hunt down. It happens that as I've gotten older, my appetite for inventing fantasy storylines has been greatly diminished, and I now find the back-end code and game mechanics more interesting than the superficial decoration. Feel free to suggest any plotline ideas you may come up with, but in my opinion, the game does not urgently need a plot.

### The Battle Screen

This is the "battle screen," where most of the game's action takes place. Your character (Lex, the green bookworm on the left) and the enemy (on the right) take turns attacking each other, and the winner is whoever depletes the other player's health bar first.

During your turn, you must spell a word by clicking on letter tiles in the 4 by 4 grid. To deselect selected tiles, click on the word you've spelled and all of its tiles will be returned to the grid below. When you're satisfied with your word, click "attack" to attack the enemy. Longer words deal more damage, as do words containing "difficult" letters like Q, X, and Z. Abbreviations, acronyms, proper nouns, and other "pseudo-words" are not valid words, and if you try to press "attack" after spelling a non-word, nothing will happen.

The enemy has a set of predetermined attacks, among which it chooses randomly with certain weighted probabilities. Look at the space below where the enemy is standing to see a list of attacks (as well as flavor text). Enemy attacks can also inflict certain special effects upon the player, such as *poison* (which continues to inflict damage periodically over the course of many turns) or *stun* (which makes the player skip a turn). These effects are indicated by colored symbols (e.g. a skull-and-crossbones means "poison", and yellow stars means "stun").

So far (as of July 8, 2002), I have been the sole programmer of BWA. I've also drawn all of the background illustrations and some of the character art. My sister Ada drew most of the character art.
